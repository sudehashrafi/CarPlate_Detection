# CarPlate_Detection
Matlab Lab Final Project - CE @ BNUT - 2021

In this project, we will get to know briefly how the automatic car license plate recognition system works, and for this purpose, we have used MATLAB tools.

This system is used in many places such as gas stations, shopping centers, airports, highways, toll booths, hotels, hospitals, parking lots, etc.
ANPR (Automatic plate number recognition) system camera captures the image of the vehicle's license plate. Then the image is processed through several algorithms to convert the digital image into a text format.

## Guide to project files:

**Template_creation.m :** This file is used to call saved images of numbers and then save them as a new template (text format) in MATLAB memory.

**Letter_detection.m :** It reads the characters from the input image and associates it with the letter and number that matches it the most.

**Plate_detection.m :** It processes the image and then calls the two files above to do the detection.

**Alpha Folder :** Contains images of numbers and letters

**Number plate Images folder :** Contains Images of license plates
